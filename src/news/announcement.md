Since 2012, Johnny-Five has relied on a [Github repo](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) to be its "home" on the web. Today we're excited to welcome the JavaScript and Maker community to our new site!

[![](/img/static/johnny-five-home.png)](/img/static/johnny-five-home.png)

The site is split up into five major sections:

## [News](/news/)

This is where you are _right now_. This will be the main outlet for Johnny-Five updates, releases and other general project bulletins or notices. We'll also highlight new contributors and the roles they will play as the project grows.

## [API](/api/)

The guts of Johnny-Five, neatly organized into component class documentation. The API documention provides descriptive details of the functionality and capabilities of each component class. There you will also find inline examples illustrating API use cases, as well as links to more detailed example programs. This content is sourced from the [Johnny-Five repo Wiki](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki).

## [Examples](/examples/)

This section includes over 150 examples that show how to write robots with Johnny-Five, from [blinking LEDs](/examples/led-blink/) to [walking hexapods](http://johnny-five.io/examples/phoenix/). All examples include a complete JavaScript program, most include a breadboard diagram, and some include photos or videos of the program in action. To add your own examples:

- Clone the [Johnny-Five repo](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/).
- Write a program and save it in the `eg/` directory.
- Create a breadboard diagram with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/).
- Add your program to `tpl/programs.json`
- Open a Pull Request!

## [Articles](/articles/)

A lot of community members are creating a lot of projects and writing alot of content about their Nodebots built with Johnny-Five. This is where we keep a central list of links to all of that work. The [Bocoup](http://johnny-five.io/articles/#bocoup) and [Node-Ardx](http://johnny-five.io/articles/#node-ardx) are static lists, so the content is always available directly from here. The  Reddit list is generated from the latest posts to [/r/Nodebots](http://www.reddit.com/r/NodeBots/), which is constantly being updated and added to by community members.

## [Platform Support](/platform-support/)

In the beginning, Johnny-Five could only communicate with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) compatible boards flashed with [StandardFirmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino), via [Firmata.js](https://github.com/jgautier/firmata). As the project has grown, so has it's platform support. Today you can create Johnny-Five programs that communicate over [serial](http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/#arduino-uno), [wifi](http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/#spark-core), [ethernet](https://github.com/rwaldron/etherport) and [bluetooth](), or execute directly on [single board computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) platforms that run Linux and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)/[io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html).



------


Just like [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) itself, [Johnny-Five.io](http://johnny-five.io/) is an open source project; this means that community contributions towards improvement are _always_ welcome! Have a look around the site and [let us know what works and what doesn't](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five.io)!
