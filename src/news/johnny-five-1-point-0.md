Hi from [JSConf US](https://2018.jsconf.us/) in sunny San Diego, Calif., where a representative group of Johnny-Five contributors [met and planned](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/issues/1463) what's next for Johnny-Five. And—ta-da!—we are thrilled to announce the release of [Johnny-Five v1.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/johnny-five/v/1.0.0)!

Don't panic. This is the Johnny-Five you already know and love. There are no breaking changes from the most recent released, tagged version ([v0.15.1](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/releases/tag/v0.15.1)). In fact, there are [zero changes at all](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

We're committing to the support of both [LTS (Long-Term Support) branches of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release), which, at time of versioning are: 8.x (active LTS) and 6.x (maintenance LTS). Already succesfully running J5 on an older version of Node.js? That's OK; it's not going to stop working overnight. We are, however, marching boldly forward: be forewarned that future releases may break on unsupported versions of Node.js.

Now we've got our [semver](https://semver.org/) wheels in motion. We're in a good position to start kicking out some of the features we've been excited about (but have been scared to ship because some are breaking). Stay tuned!
